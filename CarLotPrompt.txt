A local car dealership has asked you to write a console 
app to help them keep track of their inventory. 


They need to be able to see all their cars, add 
new cars, and sell cars. They also would like a menu
for them to easily navigate through the application. 


Using the respository pattern, create an application that allows
the user to create new cars, see all cars on the lot, and sell cars. 
You should have a program user interface and method repository. 

As an added challenge, have a menu option that allows the user to update cars,
for example: mileage was 49,000 but now it is 51,000 and needs to be updated.
